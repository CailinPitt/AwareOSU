{"name":"AwareOSU","tagline":"Be aware of crimes around the campus area.","body":"# Background\r\nOSU students (well, college students in general) enjoy being safe. Whenever a crime occurs on campus (ex. sexual assault, robbery), OSU sends every student and staff an email briefly explaining the crime. However, OSU doesn't send crime alerts for all crimes that occur *on and around* campus (where many students live). The reality is that we live in a dangerous world, and we want to be aware of what is happening around us.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\nProgram runs once every day (using a CRON job), webscrapes the [Columbus Police Department's unofficial web report portal](http://www.columbuspolice.org/reports/) and the [OSU Police department's daily log system](http://www.ps.ohio-state.edu/police/daily_log/view.php?date=yesterday), finds the previous days crimes, and emails the list of crimes to a Google Group of users who signed up for the mailing list.\r\n\r\n# Great overview. What is the code actually doing?\r\nThis Ruby program utilizes three great gems, Mechanize, Nokogiri, and Mail. This program visits the CPD web portal and OSU PD online log system (listed above) using Mechanize, parses the HTML of the search page containing all crimes committed yesterday using Nokogiri, and sends the information out in a HTML table using Mail.\r\n\r\n# Images\r\n#### Email from Aware OSU\r\n![Email from Aware OSU](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CailinPitt/AwareOSU/master/images/fullEmail.PNG)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Looks good on mobile too\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CailinPitt/AwareOSU/master/images/IMG_2862.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile\" width=\"250\" height=\"445\"/>\r\n\r\n# Goals\r\n1. Develop Android App (no current plans for iPhone because it's $100/year to be an iOS developer, poor college student problems)\r\n2. Make this more automatic (I currently have to manually add emails to send information to)\r\n3. Get Raspberry Pi and run program on there (my computer isn't always on at 9:00 AM everyday for CRON job to run)\r\n4. Possibly set up text message integration. I imagine this program texting you the number of crimes that have occurred from the previous day. I'm on the fence as to whether this is a useful feature\r\n\r\n# How to sign up\r\nVisit the [Aware OSU Google form](http://goo.gl/forms/Oy5kZ4xHbX) to sign-up.\r\n\r\n# Updates\r\n* 10/22/2015 - Program now searches and retrieves on-campus crimes, in addition to off-campus crimes. \r\n* 10/17/2015 - Google only allows GMail accounts to send up to 100 individual emails/day, so from now on I will be adding those who sign up for AwareOSU to a Google Group, and the program will email the group.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
